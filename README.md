This project demonstrates the implementation of a real-time text detection system using OpenCV and EasyOCR. The application captures live video from the default camera, detects text in each frame, and highlights the text with bounding boxes. Additionally, it identifies specific letters ('R' and 'L') to indicate directions (Right or Left).

Features:
Real-time text detection from live video feed.
Highlighting detected text with bounding boxes and displaying detected text on the frame.
Indicating directions ('Right' or 'Left') based on the presence of specific letters ('R' or 'L') in the detected text.
